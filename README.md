## Update 1 (6/16/2020)
Still unsure about what I want this game be like (might create my own art later so that they are consistent with each other even though I am really bad at art), but I am working on skills for now and will decide later. I made my first skill after half a week of working on it after seeing it in some other game.

## Update 2 (6/17/2020)
Not focused on the looks for now, just want to create working mechanics for my game.

* Improved the "feel" of the swords as they move around and turn, to make them feel more real.

* Added an attacking range to the swords, so that they will idle if there are no monsters around.

* Added an additional skill that the player might be able to use to gather all the swords for a spin attack and then disperse them.

## Update 3 (6/20/2020)

* Improved the Player controller by using Raycast to detect collisions.

* Improved the camera by making it smoother.

## Update 4 (6/26/2020)
Gave up on making my own art, it is too hard ðŸ˜ž. I will continue using public assets and hope it works out.
