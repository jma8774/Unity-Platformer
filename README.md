# Unity Platformer
My experience with Unity. My plan is to work on this all summer and see how far I can get with it.

## Update 1 (6/16/2020)
Still unsure about what I want this game be like (might create my own art later so that they are consistent with each other even though I am really bad at art), but I am working on skills for now and will decide later. I made my first skill after half a week of working on it after seeing it in some other game.

## Update 2 (6/17/2020)
Not focused on the looks for now, just want to create working mechanics for my game.

* Added an attacking range to the swords, so that they will idle if there are no monsters around.

* Added an additional skill that the player might be able to use to gather all the swords for a spin attack and then disperse them.

* Improved the "feel" of the swords as they move around and turn, to make them feel more real.

## Update 3 (6/19/2020)
* Added option to restart by pressing R
* Added a better way to spawn in the swords for now (Instead of making them appear out of thin air)

* Added HP bars to the monsters

![Update 3_2](https://media3.giphy.com/media/Pj6Uxf0gxe5YIZ4ItB/giphy.gif)
* Basic hitboxes on the monsters (The swords can now attack them using X and C)
